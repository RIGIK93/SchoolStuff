## The Method of Analysis
### 1. As you read, mark the following things as you notice them in the text.
- Repetition -> Words, phrases, details that repeat (Side note: Repetition reminds reader of the plot)
- Binary Opposition -> Words, phrases, images that are opoiste (dark/light, hot/cold)
- Anomalies -> Details that stand out because they're alone or only one
- Imagery -> words/phrasses that appeal to the five
	- sight
	- sound
	- taste
	- touch
	- smell

### 2. Look for and mark literacy/poetic devices
- Metaphor - a similie without "like" or "as"
- Similie - the comparison of one thing with another thing of a different kind, used to make a description more emphatic or vivid (e.g., _as brave as a lion_, _crazy like a fox_ ).
- Connotation/denotation - non literal/literal meaning of the word
- anaphora - Anaphora is a [figure of speech](https://www.litcharts.com/literary-devices-and-terms/figure-of-speech) in which words repeat at the beginning of successive clauses, phrases, or sentences. For example, Martin Luther King's famous "I Have a Dream" speech contains anaphora: "So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania..."
- alliteration - repetition of sound
- allusion - an expression designed to call something to mind without mentioning it explicitly; an indirect or passing reference.
- prosonoification - given natural quality to artificial things

### What to ask yourself
#### What is the setting?
- What is the time
- Where did everything take place
- etc.

2. Look for
### Book cover
1. What do you notice?
	- The splashes of paint, the cover looks half photographed, half painted
		- Means something abstract, it is like an abstract painting
			- Abstract means chaotic
				- Chaotic means something complicated, like human mind
	- Awards book won (3)
		- Worth reading
	- Hair is made from splashes, whilst face is real
		- Transition to the abstract world
	- Face is white, hair is black. Contrast
	- DIfferent words and sentences on the face of a person.
		- words are distorted
			- they're unredable, like thoughts
	- The face is dim bright~~
	- A person (woman)
	- The face expression can be explained as "wonder"

A dim or bright
in full delight
from day to night
