## Threat of Buddism
Budism dictates:
- *"Doesn't matter who your parents are, it matters what you do"*
- *"The life is suffering, it is up to you do something with it"*
> Buddism destroys Induism caste system.

*"Cui bano?"* - Who benefits?
> The best society is designed by people who don't know what part they'd take in this society

The respond to the Threat is Gita.
